k9n8ld,Thinking of moving to wellington from Melbourne,"Hello everyone,

As you read from the title, me and my partner are planning on moving to New Zealand, specifically Wellington from Melbourne. My partner's whole family are from NZ and most still live there, she's been there dozens of times and I've been once for a month long trip around the whole of nz and planning a month long road trip late 2021 or early 2022. I loved my time in NZ, it was a much more beautiful country than I anticipated and by the end of the trip I genuinely felt as if I could have stayed- my partner is the same.

So, because Wellington is both our favourite major city in NZ, we have decided that if we plan to move to NZ, it would be Wellington; mostly because most of her family live around the city, because it was more enjoyable than christchurch, Queenstown and Auckland- although the other three are still amazing cities. We're both currently doing a bachelors psychology, and social work (and masters +1 year) and were both half way through, and wanting to move after we have completed our degrees, and because my partner will do the additional 1 year to complete her masters, it will be around 2 and a half to 3 years. 

Anyway, getting to the fundamentals! How much is it roughly to rent a decent 1 bedroom apartment in Wellington (close to the CBD), what's the weather like throughout the year, and what are job prospects like for two young people who have a bachelor's and master's degree in the psychology and social work field? My partner has said that we are more likely to get a job in NZ with our degrees than here in Australia. And any advice that can help us make a decision to move to Wellington? 

Cheers!",1
g45iia,tips for moving to wellington,"Hi guys. Im hoping to graduate, get a govt job and move to welly at the end of this year.

9kv08l,What do I need to successfully secure an apartment after a viewing in Wellington?,"Wife amd I are moving to Wellington from abroad in 3 weeks. I'm looking at apartments on TradeMe in the $450-550 per week range and I see that they all require viewings in advance.

What can one do to secure an apartment after a viewing?

859dyw,Looking for IT work in Wellington,"I'm going to be moving to Wellington as of 4th April and wondered if anyone had any tips for me on finding work in the IT industry in Wellington. 

My experience in the UK IT sector was working within a large government departments data &amp; analytics team. I have experience in SAS, R, shell scripting and Python (much less experience than the aforementioned skills). 

In my previous role I did a lot of continuous improvement work on live running data services and would love to continue this kind of role or better yet develop my career further down the ""Big Data"" path.

I have a bachelor's degree in Network Computing that has gave me a good foundation for picking up new tech or programming languages. In my spare time I dabble in very amateur game design/development.

I'm looking to further develop my coding skills as I genuinely enjoy my work. The satisfaction of finding a resolution to an existing issue or problem is wonderful. 

I've already reached out to multiple recruitment agencies, have contacted some companies that people I've met on the road have mentioned and have a few ongoing enquiries. 

Any pointers, tips or nudges in the right direction would be appreciated.

d90v1e,Looking for advice | Planning to move to our nations beautiful capital.,"Hi All,

I've got a few questions regarding moving to wellington. But first, it's probably best that I explain my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

With regards to my career, I'm currently a member of a Service Management team (IT help desk) in Hawke's Bay.

I've been in the industry for around 2 years, working at a computer repair store for 1.5yr before landing my current position. 

At 16 I dropped out of High school due to mental health issues. After I got that dealt with, I got a certificate in IT essentials from a local Polytechnic. This was only so I would meet the requirements for a Bachelors degree. 

Upon starting that degree, I decided to start applying for jobs in an effort to save money, cause fuck student loans.

I have been working at my current job for around 2 months, and plan to stay for another 5-6 before I move to wellington.

There's one large problem though. 

When I move, I'll be 17.  I can imagine this would be a MAJOR problem with regards to trying to get into a flat / rent an apartment. 

According to [this](https://www.myrent.co.nz/under-18-tenants) It is possible to rent an apartment under 18, although I would need to seek approval from the Tenancy tribunal. I can imagine the majority of landlords would not want to deal with this, not to mention how big of a red flag the fact that I am under 18 is.

My questions are:

\- Does anyone have any experience trying to flat / rent an apartment under 18?

\- Any advice regarding my situation?

&amp;#x200B;

My apologies for this kind of post, as you guys do seem to get a lot of these; It's just that I couldn't find any information relevant to my situation, even from lovely Zephyr :(

92r4xh,"Looking for a Homie, a Bro, a Chum, a Pal AKA a Friend.","Well, this a little embarrassing, but It's time to try something new.

TLDR; I'm a nerd/jock that is lonely and is looking for friends.

As the title reads, I'm looking for a friend. Since moving to Wellington (Four Years ago)  I've found it hard to keep friends, NOW  I know that sounds like a warning flag... "" What, this guy can't keep friends? well, he's probably a d\*ck "".  Fair enough assumption, but that's not the case...

Here is my story, and what I Hope to achieve with this post.

I'm a chef, I've been a chef since I was 14, and when I moved to Wellington I didn't know anyone so naturally, my friends became those who I worked with.  The thing about hospo workers (I'm sure anyone who has been in the industry can agree) is the vast majority of them are travellers. So every time I became friends with someone, hung out etc, several months later they leave.  

The few Kiwis I do meet in hospo and I become friends with never last, I don't know what it is, but the friendship never lasts.  It gets to the point where we text/facebook message each other every other month, going through the motions...

"" Hey Dude, what's up? It's been a while! We should grab a beer/coffee and catch up sometime! "" - me

"" Sure man that sounds great! Let me know when you're free "" - friend

"" I'm pretty much free every night/afternoon let me know when it suits you "" - me

""Cool, I'll let you know "" - friend

\------ Weeks Later -----

"" Hey bro, you still wanna catch up? "" - me

SEEN.

Well, I am being a little dramatic, a lot of them are busy etc, but I think you get the point haha.

In a nutshell, I'm lonely, sure I have my partner and I love her but... I Want a friend, I've got plenty of mates, I got a friend I go watch the UFC With once a month -  That's pretty cool.  I got another guy who I hang out with once every three months or so.  I Just want a friend or friends, a friend who I can actually have a conversation about things, it's honestly so f\*cking brutal not having anyone to talk to.

Well, Reader, I'm not sure what you think of while reading this, my mind is literally racing with possibilities.  I imagine you either think I'm Autistic is some way or a massive dickhead/asshole.  But let me tell you a little about who I am, and maybe someone can relate...

If we were to use stereotypes,  I a nerd / Jock.  I love video games( PC gamer, WoW, Dota2, RTS - Turned Xbox gamer ), Science, debating, Philosophy, Warhammer anything geeky/nerdy I've done it or at least know about it.  On the other hand, I LOVE working out, I love being healthy.  My absolute favourite thing in the world is MMA, I can literally talk/watch fights for years.  Health and Fitness that's my jam, going to the gym for 3 hours, but then going home to play on Vanilla WoW ( Alliance, OF COURSE, Haha) Private servers and playing for 8 hours straight, or the Witcher or Stardew Vally or They are Billions or whatever I'm playing. 

I stated above, I love MMA, I don't train MMA though.  I'm working towards it, I'm joining back into BBJ and Kickboxing again soon.  I've had injuries for the last 2 - 3 years and am FINALLY injury free, /cheer

I'm a huge music fan, Classic rock and roll and Rap.  I Don't drink, by that I mean... I don't get drunk, I call myself "" Three beers Karl "" haha.  But, I can smoke with the best of them ;).

I don't know what to write, I'm so uncomfortable writing about myself/trying to sell myself lol.  I don't even know what to expect with this post, Am I going to find a friend? I dunno.

Extra helpful if the gym opens early and closes late.",0
e0vysp,Trademe rental listings question.,"I'm moving to wellington to study at Victoria.  On the trade me ads for rentals all the pictures look like they are fully furnished apartments/homes. It's much different here in the states where any pics of a rental are all empty rooms with no furniture or anything. Is it common for rentals to be furnished in wellington or are the owners just taking pics when its inhabited.  

Thank you!",0
hmzuhe,Student life,"I will be moving to wellington next February for university, and I was wondering what student life is like? In terms of concerts partying etc? And is wellington an accepting place? Moving into a new country is a little frightening, but I’m sure it’ll be worth it. And what’s the food scene like? I know that there is lush nature around, which I would enjoy. Any other fund acts would be appreciated! Thank you!",1
